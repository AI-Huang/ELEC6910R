# Hard Schedules

## before 25 May, 2018
Test the following algorithms:  
1. kmeans  
2. Meanshift  
3. ICP_k  
4. PCA and Eigenfaces  

And submit a tiny report to me through kan.huang.hkust@gmail.com|kan.huang@connect.ust.hk  

dataset: whatever  
code by your own: whatever  
language: whatever  
etc  

just as easy as possible, even a single tutorial is just fine  

further workload will be released as soon as possible, depending on the course schedule (whether can be extended or not), and it won't be too harsh  

That's all, thx
