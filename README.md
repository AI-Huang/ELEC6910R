ELEC5670/COMP5223 (previous ELEC6910R) - Robotic Perception and Learning

## Description

This course introduces the essential theoretical frameworks, methods, concepts, tools and techniques used to enable robotic perception and behavior, with particular emphasis on applications in autonomous mobile robots. The course starts from Bayesian programming and probabilistic methods, and then moves on to cover generic machine learning, especially deep learning. It also includes coverage of reinforcement learning. Important libraries for hands-on experiments for mobile robotic systems will be introduced. The students will have the opportunity to test their algorithms and implementations on real platforms.

## Intended Learning Outcomes

On successful completion of the course, students will be able to:

- 1.Discuss the importance and complexity of probabilistic modelling and information processing.
- 2.Develop first-hand know-how during class about modern robotic platforms, such as Turtlebot.
- 3.Demonstrate good comprehension of fundamentals of basic machine learning techniques by lecture assignments.
- 4.Demonstrate the ability to apply practical algorithms to realise basic perception for robotic systems by projects.
- 5.Apply knowledge in computer science, signal processing and practical programming.
  6.Use the aggregate knowledge to perform robotic tasks to operate simulated robots in simulated environment scenarios.
