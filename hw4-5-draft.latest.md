# Introduction

Programming is a good way to learn. So I make HW4 and HW5 as programming practice. You should write a report with codes and output for each task, and email your report together with your GitHub/kaggle/etc repo links.

- ICP_k
- PCA
see Homework 4 questions below
## SVM
https://github.com/ksopyla/svm_mnist_digit_classification
just test this repo, there are several methods, you should at least try two of them(like the best one and the worst one)

## K-Means
test https://www.kaggle.com/markobigdata/k-means-algorithm/code
you can set your own dataset

## ICP_k iterative closest point
### Refer to
[Matlab iterative-closest-point](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/27804-iterative-closest-point)

[Tutorials from pointclouds.org(I think it's trust worthy)](http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/interactive_icp.php)
Which requires environment of:[blender](https://www.blender.org/)

ROS packages:

### PCA-EigenFace

## Homework 4 questions
For each topic(SVM/K-Means/ICP_k/pca_and_eigenfaces), run a simple test with environment built on your on device, write a little report. Finally, submit your GitHub repo/kaggle repo/etc for review(copy and paste the results(not codes) is not allowed, the baseline is you should prove you really run it on your own environment), and your report for grade.




## Homework 5

TODO

Deep Learning

http://cs230.stanford.edu/syllabus.html
http://cs231n.stanford.edu/syllabus.html

### Reading list(optional)
https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-is-deep-learning/

Maybe combine it with course project, as a neccesity for CLO, and a warmming up of course project.
All contributions of a student can be easily integrated into his/her project.

Several ideas/topics of mine
- Image Captioning [MATH 6380O. Deep Learning, Project 2](https://deeplearning-math.github.io/project2/project2.pdf), like captioning Obama from the given picture in simulation environment
- Robotic Exploration
- CNN-SLAM
- any other ideas regarding DL are acceptable, but please verify your idea with the TA first

### References
- [A Mobile Robot Exploration Algorithm, 1992](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=182671) a very old paper, maybe is classic for refering
- [Lei Tai1 and Ming Liu, Mobile robots exploration throughÂ cnn-based reinforcement learning](https://www.ram-lab.com/papers/2016/jrobio_2016.pdf) work of our lab
